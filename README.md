# Project_Drug_Denoising
In the healthcare domain, the legibility of critical information on medicine packaging, such as expiry dates, is paramount for ensuring patient safety. However, various factors, including damage, blurring, and printing defects, can obscure this vital information on medicine strips. 
To address this issue, we propose a deep learning-based approach for denoising and enhancing medicine strip images, making crucial data like expiry dates more readable. Our method leverages advanced techniques in image super-resolution and denoising, specifically tailored to rectify unclear or partially visible expiry dates on medicine packaging. This solution not only aids healthcare professionals and patients in verifying medicine validity but also contributes the pharmaceutical industry.
## The specific aims include:
1) Data Enhancement
2) Data Denoising
3) Expiry Date Reconstruction
4) Practical Application and Integration
